                    <p>Copa America 2021 is over, and Argentina is the queen of South America after 28 years, with Messi
                        finally winning his first international title. It was a long journey with 4 group matches and
                        three
                        knock-out matches. But let’s overview how the tournament went. After rejecting the invitation
                        from
                        CONMEBOL, Qatar and Australia forced the competition to be formed of two groups of 5 teams each.
